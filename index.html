            <h2>The Parable</h2>
            <p>Three frogs sit on a log. They all decide to jump in the water. So how many frogs are wet?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> None.</p>
            <p>Why? Because making a decision is not the same as taking action.</p>

            <h2>What It Means</h2>
            <p>Deciding is easy. Acting is what changes lives. Whether it’s starting a project, mending a relationship, or just jumping in—nothing happens until you move.</p>
            <p>Don’t be the frog still sitting on the log.</p>
